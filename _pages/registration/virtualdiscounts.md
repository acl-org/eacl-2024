Discounted/sliding scale virtual registration is intended to make ACL events accessible to researchers who otherwise would be unable to participate. The <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/u0VKWMHbmi">application form</a> for discounted and free virtual registration is available. Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances. Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.

* Application: Fill out <a href="https://forms.office.com/r/u0VKWMHbmi">this form</a> 
* Deadline: February 23, 2024 (end of early registration for the conference)
* Notification: March 4, 2024
