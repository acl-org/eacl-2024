## Overview

For [EACL-2021]({{ "/" | relative_url }}), continuing with the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) initiatives at ACL sponsored conferences, especially [ACL 2020](https://acl2020.org/committees/diversity-inclusion), [EMNLP 2020](https://2020.emnlp.org/blog/2020-11-07-di-efforts) and [AACL-IJCNLP 2020](http://aacl2020.org/blog/4/), we have supported/endorsed the activities described in this blog post.

## Promoting Inclusion

We have organized different types of events to promote both academic and socio-cultural inclusion:

- **Birds of a Feather (BoF) Sessions**, for participants to discuss research in specific areas, exchange ideas and possibly identify new collaborations.
- **Language diversity** [panel and games](https://gitlab.com/ceramisch/eacl21diversity/-/wikis/EACL-2021-language-diversity-panel-and-games): we have organized events for participants, including:
  - a panel to discuss possible measures for increasing and promoting language diversity in conferences,
  - language games for giving a taster of different languages and celebrate language diversity (including an interactive presentation of the Ukrainian language).
- **Group Mentoring Sessions**, for students and early-career researchers to meet and get advice from senior researchers on various topics including career choices, work-life balance, and how to set collaborations. The sessions will be structured as round-table discussions.
- **Affinity Group Socials** to raise awareness of socio-cultural differences among our community and promote interactions. We have reached out to various groups and opened calls and will support them in hosting their events during EACL:
