Food options: There's Sole close by which is excellent but a bit high end and Melting Pot (the restaurant of the local football club) is a good choice for a quick snack. Paceville is a short 5-10 min walk away. That's the main clubbing area on the island and gets very crowded but might be worth a visit.

Encourage attendees to explore the whole island in particular:
- Valletta
- Mdina
- Hagar Qim and Mnajdra prehistoric temples
- Birgu
- Blue Grotto
- Fishing village of Marsaxlokk (fish market open on Sundays until approx 12:30)
- A boat trip to Comino which will be beautiful in March
- Explore scuba diving options
- Beaches: Mellieha Bay, Paradise Bay, Golden Bay, Ghajn Tuffieha
- Mgarr for traditional food like rabbit, horse meat and quail
