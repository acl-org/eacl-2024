<b>Registration will be opening soon.</b><br>

Based on feedback from our members, all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered at the appropriate rate for their presentation modality and status. ACL Executive Policy will be available when registration opens.

Please note that all in-person attendees must register for the conference at the in-person rates, and virtual (Underline platform) credentials should not be shared. Thus, all virtual presenters should also be registered individually. 

Findings papers only appearing in the proceedings need not have someone register, but Findings papers presented as regular posters or virtual posters should register at the appropriate rate.

If any of the above would cause financial hardship, please apply for D&I subsidies including discounted or free virtual registration using the link in the virtual registration section below.

<b>The Full Conference In-person Registration Fee Includes</b>:
- Admission to all in-person meeting sessions and the exhibition as well as the entire virtual program
- Morning and Afternoon tea and coffee break throughout the meeting 
- Admission to the Welcome Reception on Sunday, 17th of March located poolside at the Radisson Blu St. Julians. Included Light hors dâ€™oeuvre and 1 drink ticket provided.
- Admission to the Social Dinner on Tuesday, 19th March Location to be announced
- Attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the meeting

<b>The Full Conference Virtual Registration Fee Includes</b>:
- Attendance to all meeting sessions via the virtual conference platform
- Access to online poster gallery
- Access to online networking opportunities
- Attendance to all recorded sessions on demand for at least one month following the meeting

<b>Membership Fee & Policy</b>:

The ACL policy is that everyone attending an ACL conference must be a current (CY 2024) ACL member. So, in addition to the registration fee, each Regular will add $100 membership fee to their registration and each Student will add $50 membership fee to their registration if not already a 2024 paid member. Your ACL membership is for the entire calendar year, providing membership in the society devoted to promoting CL research throughout the world, open access to the CL and TACL Journals and ACL Anthology as well as access to other ACL conferences in the same year without paying membership again. Membership also entitles you to electronic notification of new issues of the journals, discounts on publications from participating publishers, announcements of ACL and related conferences, workshops, and journal calls of interest to the community.

<b>Registration Deadlines</b>:
- Early registration will end on Friday, February 23, 2024, 11:59 PM (EDT).
- Late registration starts on Saturday, February 24 and ends on Friday, March 15, 2024, 11:59 PM (EDT).
- On-site registration begins on Saturday, March 16, 2024.

<b>Note that</b>:
- Bring a copy of your registration confirmation to Registration Check-in to pick up your badge.
- If your plans change and you had selected virtual attendance but now want to attend in person, please contact Yes Events (below) to make the change and pay the difference owed. Similarly, if you cannot attend in person as you had registered, by contacting Yes Events, you may change to virtual and receive a refund for the difference (<b>fees may apply</b>).

## In-Person Pricing:

Each main conference paper must have at least one Full Conference Regular In-Person attendee registered. Please see the ACL Executive Policy.  

If you are presenting at a workshop, you do not need to register for the main conference, but you must register for the appropriate workshop. Please see the ACL Executive Policy. 

## Virtual Pricing

A discounted/sliding scale application will be available for financial aid when registration opens. 
Criteria for selection for financial aid will include your (a) country of residence, (b) employment position, (c) monthly income range, (d) available financial support from your employer/university, and (e) special circumstances. Given prioritization for those in greatest financial need, except in the case of special circumstances this additional funding is not intended for employed individuals and funded students from USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and higher income countries in Asia and the Middle East. Standard student registration rates (including from these regions) are already substantially discounted.

Given the large real costs of all conference paper presentations (whether virtual or in-person), all papers in the program (oral or poster) must have at least one author who has registered. If this is prohibitive, please contact the D&I committee.
