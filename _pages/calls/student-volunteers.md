## Call for Student Volunteers

Join us as a student volunteer at the prestigious 18th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) from March 17th through the 22nd, 2024. We're seeking dedicated students, both for in-person and online roles, to contribute to the success of this event.

### What You Gain:

Selected volunteers will receive complimentary registration to the main conference, workshops, tutorials, and social events. Shifts are designed to optimize your access to conference events.

### Roles and Responsibilities:

Volunteer tasks encompass various aspects such as assisting at the registration desk, on-boarding briefs to delegates checking in, problem solving, providing directional support at the conference venue, organizing delegate packs, overseeing poster sessions, coordinating volunteers, and providing AV/technical support, including social media management and aiding with conference events.

### Selection Criteria:

Candidates will be assessed based on their application package (details below). Preference will be given to students presenting papers at the main conference or affiliated workshops without alternative travel support



### Application Process:

* Applicants must be full-time students.
* Submission requires a completed application form <a href="https://forms.gle/SUyMyQWPAcQv1tLu7">here</a> with a few questions and a concise one-page CV (resume).
* Travel and accommodations should be arranged independently, regardless of the application outcome. Special Rate Lodging is secured by ACL Months in advance to the conference. The discounted rates can be seen and secured by following instructions at the <a href="https://2024.eacl.org/venue">following link</a>.

### Application Instructions: 

* Please refrain from registering for the EACL 2024 Conference until you receive a confirmation of acceptance into the Volunteer Service. Upon acceptance, you'll receive a dedicated registration link. Additionally, access will be provided to a Volunteer Website with essential information, FAQs, training materials, and a scheduling system to choose volunteer days and roles. To receive a complimentary registration for the EACL Event, it's crucial to note that a minimum of 10 hours of volunteer work at the event is mandatory. These hours can be divided across several shifts on different days or completed in a single shift. Failure to meet the volunteer commitment will result in being charged the in-person conference fee. 

 
*In the event of non-acceptance, the Registrar will assist in securing early registration fee rates.* For late volunteer registration reimbursements, students need to provide receipts for paid registration fees to the 2024 ACL Reimbursement Link which will be provided to you by the Volunteer Chairs.  

 
### Additional Financial Support:  

Once more, volunteering grants you complimentary registration solely for the EACL Conference. If you require further financial assistance for lodging, airfare, or daily expenses, it's advisable to apply for Diversity and Inclusion Subsidies. You have the liberty to seek both a Volunteer subsidy and a D&I subsidy simultaneously, as there are no restrictions against receiving both. To review the criteria for D&I Subsidies, please refer to the Call for D&I Post, which includes selection criteria.
