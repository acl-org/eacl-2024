<h1>EACL 2024</h1>

The 18th Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (EACL 2024) invites the submission of long and short papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research on Natural Language Processing. EACL 2024 will be held in Malta on 17th-22nd March 2024, with online attendance possible.

## Submit

Papers must be submitted via ARR at this link:

[https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October](https://openreview.net/group?id=aclweb.org/ACL/ARR/2023/October)

If you have already submitted to one of the earlier ARR deadlines, those submissions are also eligible and you do not need to (re)submit above.

As for <b>paper commitment</b>, we accept commitments from papers submitted and reviewed via ARR in the October 2023 cycle or earlier. If you opt to commit the papers to EACL 2024, please submit via the [link](https://openreview.net/group?id=eacl.org/EACL/2024/Conference).


## Important Dates

For paper submission EACL 2024 will use the [ACL Rolling Review (ARR) system](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) only. This is the case for all *ACL conferences in 2024. ARR works on a two-monthly review cycle, beginning on the 15th of every other month. The "paper submission deadline" shown below is the latest date that new papers can be submitted to ARR and be reviewed in time to be considered by EACL 2024; however, papers submitted in previous ARR rounds can of course also be considered. The "paper commitment deadline" is the date by which authors must choose, based on the reviews so far, whether to "commit" their ARR papers to be considered by EACL 2024. Papers that are committed but not accepted for EACL 2024 are not lost - they remain available in the standard ARR cycle for revision and resubmission and/or commitment to other future conferences as before.

The authors should contact ARR with any questions about the review process etc., on [editors@aclrollingreview.org](mailto:editors@aclrollingreview.org).

As in recent years, some of the presentations at the conference will be for papers accepted by the Transactions of the ACL (TACL) and Computational Linguistics (CL) journals.

## Paper Submission Information

EACL 2024 has the goal of a broad technical program. Relevant topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, the following areas (in alphabetical order):

- Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics

- Dialogue and Interactive Systems

- Discourse and Pragmatics

- Efficient/Low-resource methods in NLP

- Ethics and NLP

- Generation

- Information Retrieval and Text Mining

- Information Extraction

- Interpretability and Model Analysis in NLP

- Language Grounding to Vision, Robotics and Beyond

- Linguistic Theories, Cognitive Modeling and Psycholinguistics

- Machine Learning for NLP

- Machine Translation

- Multilinguality and Language Diversity

- NLP Applications

- Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation

- Question Answering

- Resources and Evaluation

- Semantics: Lexical

- Semantics: Sentence-level Semantics, Textual Inference and other areas

- Sentiment Analysis, Stylistic Analysis and Argument Mining

- Speech and Multimodality

- Summarization

- Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing

### Long Papers

Long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references and appendices. Upon acceptance, long papers will be given one additional page of content (i.e. up to 9 pages) in the proceedings so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

### Short Papers

Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. Please note that a short paper is not a shortened long paper. Instead, short papers should have a point that can be made in a few pages. Short papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content, plus unlimited references and appendices. Upon acceptance, short papers will be given one additional page of content (i.e. up to 5 pages) in the proceedings so that reviewers’ comments can be taken into account.

### Findings of the ACL

Papers submitted to EACL 2024, but not selected for the main conference, will also automatically be considered for publication in the Findings of the Association of Computational Linguistics. Acceptance notifications for the main track and Findings will come out simultaneously.

### Presentation Mode

Long and short papers will be presented orally or as posters, as determined by the programme committee based on the nature rather than the quality of the work. While short papers will be distinguished from long papers in the proceedings, there will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally and as posters. Papers accepted to the Findings of the ACL may present a poster.

### Presentation Requirements

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference—either online or in-person—in order to appear in the proceedings. Authors of papers accepted for presentation at EACL 2024 must notify the program chairs by the withdrawal deadline if they wish to withdraw the paper. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EACL 2024 by the early registration deadline.

### Paper Submission and Anonymity

Following standard ACL and ARR policy, submitted papers must be prepared for two-way anonymized review, and no deanonymized preprint may be posted in the month prior to submission. Please see the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more detail.

### Policies on Authorship, Citation and Ethics

EACL 2024 follows the ARR policies on authorship, citation and comparison and ethics - please see the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp).

### Multiple Submission Policy

EACL 2024 follows the ARR policy on multiple submission: we will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission, and submitted papers must not be submitted elsewhere during the review period. See the [ARR CfP](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp) for more detail. Please note that the EACL 2024 submission deadline is currently timed to come after EMNLP 2023 decisions have been announced, and that EACL 2024 acceptance decisions will be announced before the likely submission deadline for ACL 2024, although after that for NAACL 2024.

### Mandatory Discussion of Limitations

We believe that it is also important to discuss the limitations of your work, in addition to its strengths. <b>Following EACL 2023, EACL 2024 requires all papers to have a clear discussion of limitations, in a dedicated section titled “Limitations”</b>. This section will appear at the end of the paper, after the discussion/conclusions section and before the references, and will not count towards the page limit. <b>Papers without a limitations section will be automatically rejected without review</b>. Papers resubmitted from previous ARR review rounds that did not include a limitations section must ensure that such a section is included in the EACL 2024 version.

While we are open to different types of limitations, just mentioning that a set of results have been shown for English only probably does not reflect what we expect. Mentioning that the method works mostly for languages with limited morphology, like English, is a much better alternative. In addition, limitations such as low scalability to long text, the requirement of large GPU resources, or other things that inspire further investigation are welcome.
