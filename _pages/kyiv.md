Kyiv is a vibrant capital city and the center of the Ukrainian IT industry. It’s a safe and convenient destination with numerous UNESCO heritage landmarks, a rich culture and food scene, easy-to-use public transportation, and great accommodations at any price range.

Kyiv is the country’s largest city, with a population of four million. Sitting on the banks of the Dnipro River, it is one of the oldest cities in Europe, dating back to at least 500 AD
